# huvr

huvr is a fast, lightweight, and scaleable SVG button designed to introduce a short delay into an action, and present visual feedback relating to that action.

This short delay can increase a user's perceived value of an action, as well as giving them a short time to assess their decision and change their mind if necessary.
